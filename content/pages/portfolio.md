**Analista de Datos Georreferenciados en Nación Servicios:**

[**Nación Servicios**](https://www.nacionservicios.com.ar/) is the company that manages SUBE, the argentinian public transport card.
This card works in almost every province in Argentina, making it the greatest centralized 
public transport system in the world. Millions of users and tens of thousands of Buses, Trains and Metro are included in the biggest database of its kind.
My job as **Analista de Datos Georreferenciados** consisted on extracting valuable information from this database. Estimating OD Matrices, finding optimal routes and helping solve transport issues such as the accordion effect are some of my tasks.

# 2014 - 2015

**Exchange in Bergisches Universität Wuppertal**
<br>

Via Erasmus program I studied Bauingenieurwesen in the [**Bergisches Universität Wuppertal**](https://www.bauing.uni-wuppertal.de/de/studium.html). It was a normal year until the point I looked for a final project. I found an amazing group whose discipline was [**Pedestrian dynamics**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-7/EN/Research/Pedestrian_Dynamics-Empiricism/_node.html). My professors were basically the inventors of this discipline. I used Python to analyze pedestrian dynamics experiments and that is where I realized what I wanted to do for a living. Combine transport with my new born passion for programming.
