Title: About

My name is **Pablo Benavides**, I am a Civil Engineer from Granada, Spain.<br>
What is special about me? There are two things: <br>
First of all: My main tool is not AutoCAD, QGis, a Texas Calculator,
or a Structures book. My main tool is **Python**.<br>
I use it daily in my worklife and also for personal projects such as this very webpage. At work
I combine Python with my Transport knowledge to help resolve Transportation Problems.

Second of all: I want to bring back to life the good old Blog, share my professional and somehow unique career with whoever wants to read it. This is a personal project to defy my writting skills and to give order and purpose to my personal free time projects.
