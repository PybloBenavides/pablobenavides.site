Title: About

My name is Pablo Benavides, I am a Civil Engineer from Granada, Spain.<br>
What is special about me? There are two things: <br>
First of all: My main tool is not AutoCAD, or QGis, a Texas Calculator,
a Structures book or any of those. My main tool is Python.<br>
I use it daily in my worklife and also for personal projects such as this very webpage. At work
I combine Python with my Transport knowledge to try resolve Transportation Problems.

Second of all: I am going to start sharing my opinion, modern day social networks allow us 
to interact and share our thoughts with each other, but each of them has its own rules and they 
can ban you if you want. More importantly you don't want to express certain things in certain networks.<br>
This is why I want to bring back to life the good old Blog, and, if you feel like reading it, you are very welcome.
