Title: About

This is my About Page.

I am Pablo Benavides, I am a Civil Engineer from Granada, Spain.
What is special about me? Nothing much, at Work I use Python and other Programming Languages
to try resolve traffic related problems. 

In everything else I want to be a free thinker. I am sick of Linkedin, Facebook
and everywhere else I feel like a sheep going through a narrow path.
This is the page where I can make the rules and express myself both laboral and personally.
